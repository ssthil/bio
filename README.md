# bio
With 20+ years in UI/UX, Web, Mobile, and Full-Stack development, I build high-performance apps deployed across iOS, Android, and beyond.

🚀 Passionate about AI & LLMs—exploring OpenAI, Gemini, Meta Llama, DeepSeek, Anthropic, Groq, Qwen, and more. Experimenting locally with Ollama to refine prompt engineering and integrate AI into workflows.

🤝 Collaborating globally, I thrive in remote, cross-functional teams and focus on delivering clean, maintainable, and testable code.
